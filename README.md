# shopping-behavior

### Workflow:

 I started by loading the dataset `shopping.csv` and inspecting its structure. I checked for missing values, data types, and basic statistics to understand the data. For seasonal analysis, I extracted and created a new column for the season based on the purchase date. Then, analyzing the popularity of colors and clothing items across different seasons using bar charts and pie charts.

I needed to observe whether customers using a promo code or not has an effect on their spending habits. I did this by utilizing scatter plots or box plots to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts with and without promo-codes.

With further review of this data, I explored the timing of user reviews by analyzing the distribution of review dates. I also plotted a timeline of reviews to identify patterns.

After all that, I analyzed purchasing behavior based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and location. I utilized  bar charts and a heatmap to visualize the distribution of purchases among different demographics.

The most important part of this project in my opinion was documenting my key findings, visualizations, and observations in Jupyter notebooks (like what you're reading right now!). Creating visualizations with labeled axes, titles also helps in order to have a visual representation of my data and findings.

## Observations 
1.
   - Identified that warm tones like red and orange are popular in the fall, while pastel colors dominate in spring.
   - Visuals included color-coded pie charts showcasing the distribution of color preferences in each season.

2. **Popular Clothing Items by Season:**
   - Discovered that jackets and sweaters are popular in winter, while dresses and shorts are favored in summer.
   - Created bar charts illustrating the seasonal variation in the popularity of different clothing items.

3. **Effect of Promo-Codes:**
   - Observed that purchases with promo-codes tend to have a higher average dollar amount.
   - Utilized box plots to show the distribution of purchase amounts with and without promo-codes.

4. **Review Timing:**
   - Found that reviews are more frequent around holidays and special events.
   - Plotted a timeline of reviews with peaks corresponding to specific dates or seasons.

5. **Demographic Insights:**
   - Analyzed the distribution of purchases among different age groups, genders, and locations.
   - Provided insights into which demographic segments contribute most to sales.

TLDR, here is the summarization of my findings:

1. **Seasonal Trends:**
   - Adjust inventory based on seasonal preferences, ensuring an adequate supply of popular colors and clothing items for each season. (Tip: Purchasing off-season clothes can help you save money! For example, buying Winter clothes as the season in ending around late January-February. This is because shops are trying to empty their inventory and update it to the relevant seasons and trends.)

2. **Promo-Code Strategy:**
   - Implementing targeted promo-code campaigns could encourage higher-value purchases. For example, 10% off all purchases or marking down prices during big sales like Cyber Monday, Black Friday, etc can entice customers to spend more money.

3. **Demographic Targeting:**
   - Tailoring marketing strategies to specific demographics can optimize outreach. Understanding the preferences of different age groups and genders is crucial. You can see this commonly with fragrances that are heavily marketed towards men or women, towards certain events, or a specific age group.

### Challenges:

- **Data Quality:**
  - Incomplete or inaccurate data might impact the analysis. Cleaning and validating the data were essential steps to ensure reliability.

- **Limited Demographic Information:**
  - The dataset may lack detailed demographic data, making it challenging to draw precise conclusions about certain customer segments.

- **Causation vs. Correlation:**
  - While observed patterns may indicate correlations, establishing causation requires further investigation and potentially additional data.

  Overall, I enjoyed this TLAB the most because I have a much larger understanding of utilizing the libraries used and it was nice seeing how this data applies to real life.
